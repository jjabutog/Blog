        <em>A generation ago</em>, the astronomer
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carl_sagan">Carl Sagan</a> stood
        here and launched hundreds of millions of us on a great adventure the
        exploration of the universe revealed by science. It's time to get going
        again. We're about to begin a journey that will take us from the
        infinitesimal to the infinite, from the dawn of time to the distant
        future. We'll explore galaxies and suns and worlds, surf the gravity
        waves of space-time, encounter beings that live in fire and ice, explore
        the planets of stars that never die, discover atoms as massive as suns
        and universes smaller than atoms.

        It's the saga of how wandering bands of hunters and gatherers found
        their way to the stars, one adventure with many heroes. To make this
        journey, we'll need imagination. But imagination alone is not enough
        because the reality of nature is far more wondrous than anything we can
        imagine. This adventure is made possible by generations of searchers
        strictly adhering to a simple set of rules test ideas by experiment and
        observation, build on those ideas that pass the test, reject the ones
        that fail, follow the evidence wherever it leads and question
        everything.
        <strong>Accept these terms, and the cosmos is yours.</strong>

      <h2>By Matthew Ormseth and Richard Winton</h2>

      <p>
        Lauren Isackson's athletic credentials were dwarfed by those of her
        teammates. She joined the vaunted UCLA women's soccer program in 2017
        alongside members of the U.S. and Canadian national teams — elite
        athletes accustomed to dominating the high school and club circuits,
        being the best in their leagues, their states, even their entire home
        countries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Isackson's biography on the UCLA roster, meanwhile, lists her as an
        honorable mention all-league selection in 2014 for the West Bay Athletic
        League in Northern California.
      </p>
      <p>
        But even that was false, according to federal prosecutors who have
        implicated Isackson's parents in a broad conspiracy to sneak the
        children of wealthy and powerful families into top-flight universities
        they may not have been qualified to attend.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fifty people were indicted last week for their alleged roles in the
        scheme. Coaches, university officials and dozens of parents — including
        Hollywood actresses, business executives and a fashion designer — are
        accused of working in concert to rig college entrance exams and
        misrepresent applicants as recruited athletes. The Isacksons allegedly
        made their payment in Facebook stock.

          Lauren Isackson was admitted to UCLA as an athletic recruit for the
          school's elite soccer team in 2016. Her parents have been charged with
          conspiring to bribe a UCLA coach to pass her off as a recruit, with
          prosecutors saying Isackson did not play competitive soccer — she is
          still listed on the UCLA Bruins website. (UCLABruins.com)
        </p>
      </figcaption>

      <p>
        William "Rick" Singer, a college admissions consultant and the admitted
        mastermind of the scheme, said in federal court last week he bribed
        coaches to pass off his clients' children as athletic recruits, ensuring
        their admittance to elite schools like Stanford, USC, Georgetown, Yale
        and UCLA.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of the children did not even play the sport for which they were
        recruited, prosecutors say, and by the time they arrived on campus
        nearly all of them had dropped off their respective teams.
      </p>

      <h3>BUT NOT ISACKSON.</h3>
      <p>
        When she was admitted as a recruited soccer player in June 2016, a UCLA
        student-athlete admissions committee required she play on the team for
        at least one year, the indictment says.
      </p>

      <p>
        And so Isackson — who prosecutors say lacked even the modest accolades
        listed on her biography — was given the No. 41 jersey in 2017 on a team
        of all-stars and pros-in-waiting. Every other player on the roster was
        assigned a jersey number between 00 and 28.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her fellow freshmen were heralded as the second-best recruiting class in
        the nation. It included the top recruit in the country, a member of the
        Canadian national team, and five players on the U.S. youth national
        team. A university press release quoted head coach Amanda Cromwell
        saying, "When all is said and done, this class may be one of the best."
      </p>
      <p>
        Isackson did not play competitive soccer before matriculating at UCLA,
        prosecutors say, and yet for an entire season she was listed as a
        midfielder on the roster of a team that finished the 2017 season as
        runner-up to national champion Stanford. Her profile on a Pac-12 website
        says she made no appearances and played no minutes during the season.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tod Tamberg, a spokesman for UCLA, said student privacy laws prevented
        him from discussing the situations of individual students. But he said
        all teams at UCLA "include student-athletes with varying levels of
        athletic achievements."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Some team members are on the roster for the purposes of preparing the
        team for competition, and may not play in games," he said Monday.
      </p>
      <p>
        A 2017 media guide describes Isackson as a practice player. According to
        her UCLA biography, her "greatest athletic thrill" did not come on the
        soccer field, but on horseback, when she became champion of her riding
        division two years in a row.
      </p>
      <p>
        Isakson is not on the team's current roster. She is still a student at
        UCLA, according to Tamberg.
      </p>
      <p>
        Citing the indictment, Tamberg blamed Jorge Salcedo, UCLA's men's soccer
        coach, for allegedly submitting a "falsified soccer profile" to the
        university, and said the coach had been placed on leave. The school has
        initiated a review of the allegations, which is ongoing, Tamberg added.
